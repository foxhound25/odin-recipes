      <h1>Brussels Sprouts with Honey Chile Glaze</h1>
      <img src="Brussels.jpeg" alt="roasted brussels sprouts" style="width:800px;height:600px;">
      <p>I first had brussels sprouts in the UK as a part of a traditional Christmas Dinner. They were boiled with nothing but salt and pepper (and table gravy). That day, I vowed to never eat a sprout again. I broke that vow when I tried brussels sprouts prepared in the manner below. The carmelization adds depth of flavor and the sweetness of the honey and tang of vinegar provide the perfect balance. Serve these to the brussels skeptics in your life. I guarantee they will see the light.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12-16 oz. brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. honey</li>
        <li>3½ tbsp. white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp. grated lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 450˚ F. In a medium bowl, combine the brussels sprouts with the olive oil, salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Toss to coat. Arrange the sprouts on a rimmed baking sheet, cut side down. Place the baking pan on the lowest oven rack and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the outer leaves are deeply browned and crispy.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the honey in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer slightly until the honey is slightly caramelized and amber in color, a 1-2 minutes. Add the vinegar and red pepper flakes to the pan, stirring well to combine. Add in the butter and a small pinch of salt and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the glaze is smooth and slightly thickened, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>In a medium or large bowl (I just use the bowl I originally tossed the sprouts in), combine the roasted brussels sprouts with about half of the glaze. Toss to coat well and top with the lemon zest. Taste, and add more glaze as desired. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
